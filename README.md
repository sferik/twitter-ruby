A Ruby interface to the Twitter API.

## Installation
    gem install twitter

To ensure the code you're installing hasn't been tampered with, it's
recommended that you verify the signature. To do this, you need to add my
public key as a trusted certificate (you only need to do this once):

    gem cert --add <(curl -Ls https://raw.github.com/sferik/twitter/master/certs/sferik.pem)

Then, install the gem with the high security trust policy:

    gem install twitter -P HighSecurity

## Quick Start Guide
So you want to get up and tweeting as fast as possible?

First, [register your application with Twitter][register].

Then, copy and paste in your OAuth data.

```ruby
Twitter.configure do |config|
  config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
  config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
  config.oauth_token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
  config.oauth_token_secret = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
end
```

That's it! You're ready to Tweet:
```ruby
Twitter.update("I'm tweeting with @gem!")
```

## What's New in Version 5?
### Cursors
The `Twitter::Cursor` class has been completely redesigned with a focus on
simplicity and performance.

</table>

In the examples above, *n* is dependent on the number of people the
authenticated user follows on Twitter (divided by 20, the number of friends you
can fetch per request). So, if the user followers 85 people, calling
`Twitter.friends.take(20)` would make 6 HTTP requests in version 4. In version
5, it makes just 1 HTTP request. Keep in mind, eliminating a single HTTP
request to the Twitter API will reduce the latency of your application by
[about 500 ms][status].

[status]: https://dev.twitter.com/status

The last example might seem contrived ("Why would I need to call
`Twitter.friends.take(20)` twice?") but it applies to any
[`Enumerable`][enumerable] method you might call on a cursor, including:
`#all?`, `#collect`, `#count`, `#each`, `#inject`, `#max`, `#min`, `#reject`,
`#reverse_each`, `#select`, `#sort`, `#sort_by`, and `#to_a`. In version 4,
each time you called one of those methods, it would perform *n+1* HTTP
requests. In version 5, it will only perform those HTTP requests the first time
one of those methods is called. Each subsequent call fetches data from a
[cache][cache].

[enumerable]: http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html
[cache]: https://github.com/sferik/twitter/commit/7d8b2727af9400643ac397207185fd54e3f6387b

The performance improvements are actually even **better** than the table above
indicates. In version 5, calling `Twitter::Cursor#each` (or any
[`Enumerable`][enumerable] method) starts yielding results immediately and
continues yielding as each response comes back from the server. In version 4,
`#each` made a series of requests and waited for the last one to complete
before yielding any data.

Here is a list of the interface changes to `Twitter::Cursor`:

* `#first` has been replaced by `#first?`.
* `#first` now returns the first element in the collection, as prescribed by `Enumerable`.
* `#last` has been replaced by `#last?`.
* `#all` has been replaced by `#to_a`.
* `#collection` and its aliases have been removed.

### Search Results
The `Twitter::SearchResults` class has also been redesigned to have an
[`Enumerable`][enumerable] interface. The `#statuses` method and its aliases
(`#collection` and `#results`) have been replaced by `#to_a`. Additionally,
this class no longer inherits from `Twitter::Base`. As a result, the `#[]`
method has been removed without replacement.

### Trend Results
The `Twitter::API::Trends#trends` method now returns an
[`Enumerable`][enumerable] `Twitter::TrendResults` object instead of an array.
This object exposes the recency of the trend (via `#as_of`), when the trend
started (via `#created_at`), and the location of the trend (via `#location`).
This information was previously unavailable.

### Users
The `Twitter::User` object has been cleaned up. The following methods have been
removed:

* `#from_user`
* `#from_user_id`
* `#from_user_name`
* `#to_user`
* `$to_user_id`
* `to_user_name`
* `profile_image_url`
* `profile_image_url_https`

These attributes can be accessed through the `#user` method.

## Configuration
Twitter API v1.1 requires you to authenticate via OAuth, so you'll need to
[register your application with Twitter][register]. Once you've registered an
application, make sure to set the correct access level, otherwise you may see
the error:

    Read-only application cannot POST

Your new application will be assigned a consumer key/secret pair and you will
be assigned an OAuth access token/secret pair for that application. You'll need
to configure these values before you make a request or else you'll get the
error:

    Bad Authentication data

Applications that make requests on behalf of a single Twitter user can pass
global configuration options as a block to the `Twitter.configure` method.

```ruby
Twitter.configure do |config|
  config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
  config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
  config.oauth_token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
  config.oauth_token_secret = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
end
```

Alternately, you can set the following environment variables:

    TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY
    TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET
    TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN
    TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET

After configuration, requests can be made like so:

```ruby
Twitter.update("I'm tweeting with @gem!")
```

### Thread Safety
Applications that make requests on behalf of multiple Twitter users should
avoid using global configuration. In this case, you may still specify the
`consumer_key` and `consumer_secret` globally. (In a Rails application, this
could go in `config/initializers/twitter.rb`.)

```ruby
Twitter.configure do |config|
  config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
  config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
end
```

Then, for each user's access token/secret pair, instantiate a
`Twitter::Client`:

```ruby
erik = Twitter::Client.new(
  :oauth_token => "Erik's access token",
  :oauth_token_secret => "Erik's access secret"
)

john = Twitter::Client.new(
  :oauth_token => "John's access token",
  :oauth_token_secret => "John's access secret"
)
```

You can now make threadsafe requests as the authenticated user:

```ruby
Thread.new{erik.update("Tweeting as Erik!")}
Thread.new{john.update("Tweeting as John!")}
```

Or, if you prefer, you can specify all configuration options when instantiating
a `Twitter::Client`:

```ruby
client = Twitter::Client.new(
  :consumer_key => "an application's consumer key",
  :consumer_secret => "an application's consumer secret",
  :oauth_token => "a user's access token",
  :oauth_token_secret => "a user's access secret"
)
```

This may be useful if you're using multiple consumer key/secret pairs.

### Middleware
The Faraday middleware stack is fully configurable and is exposed as a
`Faraday::Builder` object. You can modify the default middleware in-place:

```ruby
Twitter.middleware.insert_after Twitter::Response::RaiseError, CustomMiddleware
```

A custom adapter may be set as part of a custom middleware stack:

```ruby
Twitter.middleware = Faraday::Builder.new(
  &Proc.new do |builder|
    # Specify a middleware stack here
    builder.adapter :some_other_adapter
  end
)
```

[stats]: https://rubygems.org/gems/twitter

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.9.2
* Ruby 1.9.3
* Ruby 2.0.0

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it's a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be responsible for providing patches in a timely
fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time
of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.

## Versioning
This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver]. Violations
of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, if a minor or patch
version is released that breaks backward compatibility, that version should be
immediately yanked and/or a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will only be
introduced with new major versions. As a result of this policy, you can (and
should) specify a dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version
Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'twitter', '~> 4.0'
