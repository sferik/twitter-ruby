## What's new in version 3?

### Dependencies

The Active Support dependency has been removed!

### Methods

The following methods now accept multiple users or ids as arguments and return
arrays:

    Twitter::Client#accept                  Twitter::Client#enable_notifications    Twitter::Client#saved_search_destroy
    Twitter::Client#block                   Twitter::Client#favorite                Twitter::Client#status_destroy
    Twitter::Client#deny                    Twitter::Client#follow                  Twitter::Client#unblock
    Twitter::Client#direct_message_destroy  Twitter::Client#report_spam             Twitter::Client#unfavorite
    Twitter::Client#disable_notifications   Twitter::Client#retweet                 Twitter::Client#unfollow

Whenever more than one user or id is passed to any of these methods, HTTP
requests are made in parallel using multiple threads, resulting in dramatically
better performance than calling these methods multiple times in serial.

The `Twitter::Client#direct_messages` method has been renamed to
`Twitter::Client#direct_messages_received`.

Additionally, the `Twitter::Client#follow` method now checks to make sure the
user isn't already being followed. If you don't wish to perform that check
(which does require an extra HTTP request), you can use the new
`Twitter::Client#follow!` method instead. **Note**: This may re-send an email
notification to the user, even if they are already being followed.

The `Twitter::Client#search` now returns a `Twitter::SearchResult` object,
which contains metadata and a results array. In the previous major version,
this method returned an array of `Twitter::Status` objects, which is now
accessible by sending the `results` message to a `Twitter::SearchResults`
object.

##### Version 2
    Twitter::Client.search("query").map(&:full_text)

##### Version 3
    Twitter::Client.search("query").results.map(&:full_text)

The `Twitter::Status#expanded_urls` method has been removed. Use
`Twitter::Status#urls` instead.

Support for API gateways via `gateway` configuration has been also removed.
This functionality may be replicated by inserting custom Faraday middleware.

### Configuration

The Faraday middleware stack is now fully configurable and is exposed as a 
`Faraday::Builder` which can be manipulated in place:

    Twitter.middleware.insert_after Twitter::Response::RaiseClientError, CustomMiddleware
    
Likewise, the middleware stack can be replaced in it's entirety:

    Twitter.middleware = Faraday::Builder.new(&Proc.new { |builder|
      # Specify a middleware stack here
    })

As part of these configuration changes we've removed `adapter` configuration. 
If you would like to change the adapter used, you can do so by setting Faraday's
`default_adapter`:

    Faraday.default_adapter = :some_other_adapter
    
The adapter can also be configured as part of the middleware stack:

    Twitter.middleware = Faraday::Builder.new(&Proc.new { |builder|
      # Specify a middleware stack here
      builder.adapter :some_other_adapter
    })

### Authentication

This library now attempts to pull credentials from `ENV` if they are not
otherwise specified. In `bash`:

    export TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
    export TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
    export TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN=YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
    export TWITTER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET

### Identity Map

This version introduces an identity map, which ensures that the same objects
only get initialized once:

    Twitter.user("sferik").object_id == Twitter.user("sferik").object_id #=> true

(In all previous versions of this gem, this statement would have returned
false.)

### Errors

Any Faraday client errors are captured and re-raised as a
`Twitter::Error::ClientError`, so there's no longer a need to separately rescue
`Faraday::Error::ClientError`.

The `Twitter::Error::EnhanceYourCalm` class has been removed, since all Search
API requests are made via api.twitter.com, which does not return HTTP 420. When
you hit your rate limit, Twitter returns HTTP 400, which raises a
`Twitter::Error::BadRequest`.

### Additional notes

This will be the last major version of this library to support Ruby 1.8.
Requiring Ruby 1.9 will allow us to remove [various][each_with_object]
[hacks][singleton_class] put in place to maintain Ruby 1.8 compatibility.
[The first stable version of Ruby 1.9 was released on August 19, 2010.][ruby192]
If you haven't found the opportunity to upgrade your Ruby interpreter since
then, let this be your nudge. Once version 4 of this library is released, all
previous versions will cease to be supported, even if critical security
vulnerabilities are discovered.

## Performance
You can improve performance by preloading a faster JSON parsing library. By
default, JSON will be parsed with [okjson][]. For faster JSON parsing, we
recommend [Oj][].

[okjson]: https://github.com/ddollar/okjson
[oj]: https://rubygems.org/gems/oj

## Usage Examples
Return [@sferik][sferik]'s location

    Twitter.user("sferik").location
Return [@sferik][sferik]'s most recent Tweet

    Twitter.user_timeline("sferik").first.text
Return the text of the Tweet at https://twitter.com/sferik/statuses/27558893223

    Twitter.status(27558893223).text
Find the 3 most recent marriage proposals to [@justinbieber][justinbieber]

    Twitter.search("to:justinbieber marry me", :rpp => 3, :result_type => "recent").results.map do |status|
      "#{status.from_user}: #{status.text}"
    end

Let's find a Japanese-language Tweet tagged #ruby (no retweets)

    Twitter.search("#ruby -rt", :lang => "ja", :rpp => 1).results.first.text

Certain methods require authentication. To get your Twitter OAuth credentials,
register an app at http://dev.twitter.com/apps

    Twitter.configure do |config|
      config.consumer_key = YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY
      config.consumer_secret = YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET
      config.oauth_token = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN
      config.oauth_token_secret = YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET
    end
Update your status

    Twitter.update("I'm tweeting with @gem!")
Read the most recent Tweet in your timeline

    Twitter.home_timeline.first.text
Get your rate limit status

    rate_limit_status = Twitter.rate_limit_status
    "#{rate_limit_status.remaining_hits} Twitter API request(s) remaining for the next #{((rate_limit_status.reset_time - Time.now) / 60).floor} minutes and #{((rate_limit_status.reset_time - Time.now) % 60).round} seconds"

## Supported Ruby Versions
This library aims to support and is [tested against][travis] the following Ruby
implementations:

* Ruby 1.8.7
* Ruby 1.9.2
* Ruby 1.9.3
* [JRuby][]
* [Rubinius][]

[jruby]: http://www.jruby.org/
[rubinius]: http://rubini.us/

If something doesn't work on one of these interpreters, it should be considered
a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby
implementations, however support will only be provided for the versions listed
above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may
volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests
run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your
implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a
timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the
time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
