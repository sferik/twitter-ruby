If you're seeing this message, that means you're using the old Twitter Ruby gem
which is no longer maintained and will not support Twitter API v2.

🎉 Here's the good news:
We recommend switching to the X gem, which supports both API v1.1 and v2. It's
a robust, modern libary that is designed to ensure you'll be able to easily
integrate forthcoming API changes.

🤔 Please consider sponsoring
The X gem is free to use, but with new API pricing tiers, it actually costs
money to develop and maintain. By contributing to the project, you help:

1. 🛠  Maintain the library: Keeping it up-to-date and secure.
2. 🌈 Add new features: Enhancements that make your life easier.
3. 💬 Provide support: Faster responses to issues and feature requests.
⭐️ Bonus: Sponsors will get priority influence over the project roadmap.
Your company's logo will also be displayed on the project's GitHub page.

🔗 To sponsor, visit: https://github.com/sponsors/sferik

Building and maintaining an open-source project like this takes a considerable
amount of time and effort. Your sponsorship can help sustain this project. Even
a small monthly donation makes a big difference!

💖 Thanks for considering sponsorship. Together we can make the X gem even better!
